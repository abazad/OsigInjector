## A personal note
If some things are not working as intended, or you have any suggestions how I could improve this project, please let me know. I'm only human, could've missed something. ðŸ˜„ 
 
## Dependencies
### External
* APKtool, as `apktool.bat` in the working directory.
	* Get it [here](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/).
* Java Development Kit, with `jarsigner` in system `PATH` variable (`bin` folder).
* Android Build Tools containing `zipalign`, also in `PATH`.

### Personal
* A keystore file, with access to the target alias and passwords.
* Text files containing the passwords for both the keystore as the key.
	* Done for the reason that escaped characters will be read correctly (had some issues in the console window).

## Build it yourself
Microsoft Visual Studio version capable of targeting .NET Framework 4.6.1 (lower versions should work just fine though). The project integrates a NuGet package for parsing command line entries, [CommandLineParser by Giacomo Stelluti Scala](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CommandLineParser/). Make sure NuGet fixes packages before building yourself a copy.
